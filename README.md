### OpenCV Yolo: SOURCE (Links to an external site.)
###cRun this above code on your laptop or Colab. 
### Take an image of yourself, holding another object which is there in COCO data set (search for COCO classes to learn). 
### Run this image through the code above. 
### Upload the link to GitHub implementation of this
### Upload the annotated image by YOLO. 
### Training Custom Dataset on Colab for YoloV3
### Refer to this Colab File: LINK (Links to an external site.)
### Refer to this GitHub Repo (Links to an external site.)
### Collect a dataset of 500 images and annotate them. Please select a class for which you can find a YouTube video as well. Steps are explained in the readme.md file on GitHub.
### Once done:
### Download (Links to an external site.) a very small (~10-30sec) video from youtube which shows your class. 
### Use ffmpeg (Links to an external site.) to extract frames from the video. 
### Upload on your drive (alternatively you could be doing all of this on your drive to save upload time)
### Inter on these images using detect.py file. **Modify** detect.py file if your file names do not match the ones mentioned on GitHub. 
### python detect.py --conf-thres 0.3 --output output_folder_name`
